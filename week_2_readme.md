## Code

The main topic this week was: **Finishing the Drive train code and working on the code for the encoders.**

Commands: **[EncoderDrive]**

Subsystems: **[Drivetrain, Constants, and RobotContainer]**

### How does the code work?
Encoder code finds the disatance required to cover to get to a set point, then, calculated the circumfrance of the wheel and divides both of the terms to get how many rotations we need, but we are useing encoders convert these values to ticks which the robot can understand.
